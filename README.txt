#BlogSpot Reader

Why BlogSpot Reader?
  Most of the bloggers that I have met, Keep on writing and posting a lot of creative stuff online.
  But overtime they realise a need of backup of all the Blogs 
  But to do it manually is a tedious and devastating job!!!!
  
  So I have came up with a code that, Does some webscrapping and retrives all the blog's links and Gives option to the User of choosing archives of which month or year to be retrived
  
  
Python Features 
  1. Beautiful Soup
  2. Urllib
  3. RegEx
  4. Some logic :P
